                                bend a web-page to my will--pieces like my expanding gradients were particularly exciting to complete. My understanding of visual design and UI/UX flow will hopefully come through in this first attempt at a 
                                proper web-page, though I know as I continue to build websites and hone my usage of CSS and HTML, my skills will improve drastically.
