                            <p>Born directly from my own love of movement based shooters, I set out to prove that high-motion games can absolutely work in a VR enviornment. I spent a majority of this time nailing down the mechanics behind climbing and swining, which 
                                felt integral to the success of a movement based VR game. Bunnyhopping concpets were taken from the Titanfall series, where sliding and jumping allow the player to preserve their speed. All mechanics and visuals present in this game were built by me. 
                                Unfortunately, like many of my projects, it did not see a release as I was unable to find an artist or create my own art.

                        <p>This VR project was built to test the limitations of motion in VR. This project centered around the concepts of player motion that feel the most fun to play with in flat-screen, first-person games--grappling hooks and bunnyhopping. It features 
                            a fully fleshed out system for climbing, swinging, jumping, and combat. It was iterated on several times, many of which featured a combination of hand-held daggers, which could be thrown and teleported to while in motion. Ultimately, the final concept 
                            revolved around empty hands, which would enable the user to interact more easily with the objects in their environment.

                            <p>This project was largely inspired by the Counter-Strike 1.6 gameplay mod, known as American Football Mod. It borrows the throwing mechanic and movement types seen present in this mod. All systems present here were built by me, and multiplayer systems were 
                                tested by myself and a close friend. Gameplay was fun, however due to art limitations and a lack of time, this project did not make it far past the prototyping phase. I have revisited this concept a number of times, and still believe this concept of first-person 
                                football could be quite popular!

                            <p>I am an avid enjoyer of both watching and performing Half-Life speedruns, so this project was an oppurtinity to pour my love for the game into my own concept. The movement code is derived from Half-Lifes air-strafing mechanics, which center around a quirk 
                                with vector projections. I built these systems to feel as close as possible to the real thing, and even borrowed some other concepts from other Valve titles (who doesnt love the Force-A-Nature?). I would love to see this concept fleshed out into a fully developed game, though for 
                                commercial release, it would likely need to be more detached from the existing movement systems in Half-Life.

                            movement systems in Half-Life 1, where air-strafing allows for player acceleration, and only frames spent on the ground will slow the player down. This game is built on top of the Unity FPS sample project, and centered around maps featuring small platforms, which the player must bunnyhop between 
                            to maintain their momentum and clear gaps. A finished version of this prototype would feature common 3D platformer tropes, including hidden gems, platforming based enemies, and speed-trials. It also centered around weapons which could assist the player both 
                            in combat and navigating tight platforming sections.

                            <p>Wintermaul was a favorite custom game of mine during my time playing Warcraft 3, and I was quite dissapointed to find that no-one had revisited the concept in the modern games era. I decided to jump at the oppurtinity, with hopes to release the game, in full, 
                                at some point in the near future. This game is still very early in development, so a lot of major features are still missing, but my own love of the concept joined with my close friends love of Tower Defense games, has kept my motivation alive to continue pursuing this project.

                                hope for it to become my first full-release!
